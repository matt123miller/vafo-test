Please find attached a Figma file for the technical task. Within the file are instructions, components, and an example page (mobile and desktop) that we would like you to build.

Requirements:

Use Astro (https://astro.build/) as the front-end framework
Scoped styles using vanilla CSS
Working image carousel
Meets AA WCAG 2.2 accessibility standards (where the design allows - some colours donâ€™t meet this)
Modern HTML/CSS/JS is encouraged

Once complete, add to a git repository and share with me (github.com/jonmaskrey) at your earliest convenience (after your holiday).
